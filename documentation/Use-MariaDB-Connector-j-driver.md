# Using the driver

The following subsections show the formatting of JDBC connection strings for
MariaDB, MySQL  database servers.  Additionally, sample code is provided that
demonstrates how to connect to one of these servers and create a table.


## Driver Manager

Applications designed to use the driver manager to locate the entry point need
no further configuration, MariaDB Connector/J will
automatically be loaded and used in the way any previous MySQL driver would
have been.

## Driver Class 

Please note that the driver class provided by MariaDB Connector/J **is not
`com.mysql.jdbc.Driver` but `org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver`**!


## Connection strings

Format of the JDBC connection string is 
```script
jdbc:(mysql|mariadb):[replication:|failover:]//<hostDescription>[,<hostDescription>...]/[database][?<key1>=<value1>[&<key2>=<value2>]] 
```

 HostDescription:
```script
<host>[:<portnumber>]  or address=(host=<host>)[(port=<portnumber>)][(type=(master|slave))]
```

Host must be a DNS name or IP address. In case of ipv6 and simple host
description, the IP address must be written inside brackets.  The default port
is ##3306##.  The default type is ##master##. If ##replication## failover is
set, by default the first host is master, and the others are slaves.

Examples : 
* localhost:3306
* [2001:0660:7401:0200:0000:0000:0edf:bdd7]:3306
* somehost.com:3306
* address=(host=localhost)(port=3306)(type=master)


### Failover parameters

Failover was introduced in Connector/J 1.2.0.
See [failover and high availability documentation](./Failover-and-high-availability.md) for more informations.


| Failover option | Description| 
| ------------ |:----------------| 
| **failover** | High availability (random picking connection initialisation) with failover support for master replication cluster (for example Galera). <br/>*Since 1.2.0*|
| **sequential** |Failover support for master replication cluster (for example Galera) **without** High availability. <br/>the host will be connected in the order in which they were declared.<br/><br/>Example when using the jdbc url string "jdbc:mysql:replication:host1,host2,host3/test" : <br/>When connecting, the driver will always try first host1, and if not available host2 and following. After a host fail, the driver will reconnect according to this order.<br/>*Since 1.3.0*|
| **replication** | High availability (random picking connection initialisation) with failover support for master/slaves replication cluster (one or multiple master).<br/>*Since 1.2.0*|
| **aurora** | High availability (random picking connection initialisation) with failover support for Amazon Aurora replication cluster.<br/>*Since 1.2.0*|

## JDBC API Implementation Notes
### Streaming result sets
By default, `Statement.executeQuery()` will read full result set
from server before returning. With large result sets, this will require large
amounts of memory. Better behavior in this case would be reading row-by-row,
with `ResultSet.next()`, so called "streaming" feature. It is
activated using `Statement.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE)`


### CallableStatement
Callable statement implementation won't need to access stored procedure
metadata ([[mysqlproc-table|mysql.proc]]) table if both of following are true

* CallableStatement.getMetadata() is not used
* Parameters are accessed by index, not by name

When possible, following the two rules above provides both better speed and
eliminates concerns about SELECT privileges on the
[[mysqlproc-table|mysql.proc]] table.

### Optional JDBC classes
Following optional interfaces are implemented by the
org.mariadb.jdbc.MariaDbDataSource class : javax.sql.DataSource,
javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource, javax.sql.XADataSource

## Usage examples

The following code provides a basic example of how to connect to a MariaDB or
MySQL server and create a table.  

### Creating a table on a MariaDB or MySQL Server
```java
Connection  connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test", "username", "password");
Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
stmt.executeUpdate("CREATE TABLE a (id int not null primary key, value varchar(20))");
stmt.close();
connection.close();
```
